Aim to characterize and showcase literary and philosophical
developments, with deep linguistic undertanding.

Trained on layered corpora of foundational texts in literature. A single
training set consists of 3 levels of text data:  

* Level -1: “background, generic world knowledge” texts prerequisite for understanding. Use the supervisory texts to inform a generative model of the fundamental units and considerations and patterns with which to create something interesting. 
* Level  0: literary books of a particular author, say Dostoyevsky.
* Level  1: related corpus of “supervisory” texts that critique and analyze Dostoyevsky

Repeat this process for several authors and conceptual periods over time,
guiding relational analysis between authors or concepts by the supervisory
material itself. 


Event causality, in which actions take place on objects and results are
observed (e.g. conceptual, human, real, fantasized) should be a core reasoning
block. Analytical and Structural models of various literary forms; novel,
critique, essays. This requires: parts of speech recognition, global conceptual
knowledge system, updating mechanisms for new reading, writing, and implicit
reflection on own writing.  

How do Linguistic mechanics enhance reasoning and parsing?  Mechanics such as
grammar, tenses, sentence structures, etymology (conceptual origins and related
words). 

Trustworthiness: Quantify Uncertainty, Cite Sources, exposit internal knowledge
structures and decision making.

Steps: 
1. Create an exhaustive corpus within the specified groupings of literature. Search precisely for related material.
2. Train language models (either a. small, novel architectures or b. Fine-tune pre-trained large models)
    - The expense of not training on “all of internet/written knowledge” is to gain an edge on knowledge purity. 
    - Due to the restriction on the type of input data, stronger assumptions can be made about their importance, format, and substance. 
3. Developing several interworking structural models may be needed to allow for extrapolation and connective, deductive reasoning .  
    - internal knowledge structures, updating functions, parsing, generative, expository algorithms. 
    - Computational and memory efficiency for complex system. 
4. How to validate ?   How to quantify quality ? 
    - The system should then write essays to explore open literary questions, and submit a paper to popular journals in literary theory.
    - The system should then assess new publications and publish literary reviews in a newspaper. 
    - The system should write a new short story.
